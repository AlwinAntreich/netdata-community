- [correlation_heatmap.ipynb](correlation_heatmap.ipynb): A notebook that pulls some recent data from multiplr hosts and plots some pretty correlation heatmaps. 
- [anomaly_detection.ipynb](anomaly_detection.ipynb): A notebook that pulls some recentv data from a specific node and runs it though variable anomaly detection algorithms using the awesome [ADTK](https://adtk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) library.
